# Steam Scraper
## A simple web scraping app built in Python

By Trevor Corcoran

Built for use in my Database class semester project. It aims to simply grab some essential data about steam games in an efficient manner.

### Tools

* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) => Python dependency management
* [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) => Web scraping library

### Getting started

You will need to have Poetry installed, along with a modern Python interpreter. Then run

`poetry install`

With poetry having installed the correct dependencies, simply run

`poetry run python scrape.py`
